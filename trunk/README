===============================

NOTES :
    This is a release of phpWatch 2.  As such, it is not compatible with any phpWatch 1.x.x and must be installed in a
    clean directory, free of any phpWatch 1.x.x files.  Further, it is not currently possible to import settings,
    monitors, nor contact information from phpWatch 1.x.x into a 2.x.x released.

EASY INSTALL :
    1) Change the permissions on config.php within the root directory to allow for writing.
    2) Navigate to the install directory from a web browser and follow the instructions.
    3) Delete the install directory and change the permissions of config.php to disallow writing.

MANUAL INSTALL :
    If you prefer a manual installation:
    1) Fill in the database host, user, password, and name in config.php.
    2) Import install/dump.sql into the specified database.
    3) Navigate to the root directory of phpWatch and verify there are no errors.
