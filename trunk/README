  phpWatch 2.x.x Beta Release
===============================

Thank you for trying this very early release of phpWatch 2.  At the moment there is no installer script and this file is
designed to walk you through the process.

1) Create a mySQL database and an associated user with (at least) SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE privileges.
2) Import "dump.sql" into the newely created database.
3) Fill in the hostname, username, password, and database name in config.php.  For example, a completed config.php file
may look like:

    <?php
        $PW2_CONFIG = array(
            'db_scheme' => 'MySQL',
            'db_info' => array(
                'host' => 'localhost',
                'user' => 'mysql_user_name',
                'pass' => 'mysql_user_password',
                'db' => 'mysql_database_name'
            ),
            'path' => dirname(__FILE__),
        );

        define('PW2_VERSION', '2.0.2 Beta');
        define('PW2_PATH', $PW2_CONFIG['path']);
    ?>

4) Setup a cronjob (or scheduled task in Windows) that runs cron.php in the root directory of phpWatch 2 at a desired frequency.
Keep in mind, a full path should be used.  For example, to setup a cronjob that runs every 5 minutes, run "crontab -e"
and add the following line to the end of the file:

    */5 * * * * php /path/to/phpwatch/root/directory/cron.php

5) Visit the root directory of phpWatch in a browser.  Assure there are no errors shown.
